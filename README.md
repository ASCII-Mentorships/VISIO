# VISIO 
## Introduction
- Visio is a data collection device used to collect human behavioral data.
- It a piece of custom built hardware that is attached to the spectacles of the user.
- The goal of this project is to develop a smart system that can fetch user physiological data and collect it so that the Data Science team can work on it.
- Please note that the hardware is completely custom-built and made from scratch.

## VISIO : V1
- The first version of Visio is implemented, and will be used to do a primitive user study.
- This version has the bare minimum functionalities. 
	- It has a Camera (OV2460) and a Microcontroller (ESP32). 
	- The Microcontroller is interfaced to the Camera.
	- The system works on a request-response model.
	- The image can be fetched by making a get-request to the microcontroller's home address.
- These are some pictures of the Visio V1 
	- (Will be added soon)



- The main aim of this version was to set up a working pipeline.
- The next version V2 will have more features and a better firmware to utilize all the available computational power.

## VISIO : V2
- The next version of Visio will be focused on adding more features and optimizing the firmware.
- Various new sensors like IMU, Touch, Dual-Camera, etc are to be added. The exact list is not finalized yet.
- This version will be better than V1 in terms of efficiency, number of sensors, power consumption.


## Goals
- The main aim of this project is to get the members acquainted with developing an Embedded system from scratch. 
- The Embedded system includes the hardware, as well as firmware. Both are equally important.
- If you work on this project you will learn about Embedded Systems, firmware development, system design.

## Prerequisites
- Basics of Electronics (Coursework of ES(First Year) is more than enough).
- Primary knowledge of C, C++, Python programming.
- Arduino basics.
- Willingness to devote a fixed time every week to the project.
- Work in a team.
- Willingness to learn.
- First 3 skills are a good thing to have. But if you do not know them, its okay. What matters the most is the interest you show in the project.

## Resources
- Go through the resources folder in the repo.

## Remarks
- This project is Electronics intensive, but a lot of CS concepts are being used. If you find this description of the project interesting do give this a shot.
- This will be a very good project to put on your resume.
